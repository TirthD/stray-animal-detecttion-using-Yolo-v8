#### Abstract

The core mission of the "Stray Animal Detection Using Yolov8" project is to establish a safer urban
environment through the deployment of an advanced surveillance framework.

The system's cornerstone is the incorporation of machine learning algorithms, designed to meticulously
detect and monitor stray animals across varied urban landscapes.

By harnessing the power of video analytics, the system enables the swift identification and tracking of stray
animals.

Furthermore, the project emphasises the significance of timely alerts to relevant authorities or animal control
agencies, thereby fostering a proactive approach to mitigating risks associated with stray animals.

Ultimately, this innovative initiative seeks to create a balanced and secure urban setting where technology
and compassion converge for the benefit of both human and animal populations.
